(This is a scaffold project. I'll be providing scaffolds throughout the semester
to get you working faster, and to make grading much easier for the TA team.)

(Your overarching goal is to edit/modify this document to NOT look like I gave it to you, but rather customize
it to your own editorial and artistics standards.  At a minimum, you should delete anything in parenthesis!
I'll try to provide you with instructions, like those below, for what should go into each section.  As
you get more practice, you'll not need my guidance for pulling these report formats together!)

(The autograder will scan this QMD searching for snippets of my original text.  It will take off points
if it finds any!)

(Please remove these first paragraphs and add your own intro/overview section.)

(Please edit the text below while KEEPING the header2 ## /header3 ### structure outline structure.)

(In your own words, add an overview of the assignment in this section.  Your audience is a student in another class who might know much about database design.  What is this assignment about?  What are the funning diagrams?)

### Conceptual design in Chen Notation

(description here.  modify diagram!)

```{dot}
//| label: fig-chen-1
//| fig-cap: "A simple Chen Diagram"
//| fig-width: 100%
graph ER {
    // "graph" creates undirected graphs.  It can be used for more than just ER diagrams!
    // There are many different layouts.  We're going to use layout=neato 
    // See: https://graphviz.org/
    //      https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html
    //      https://graphviz.org/docs/layouts/
    //      https://graphviz.org/docs/layouts/neato/


    // these commands apply only to the main title/label
    // I added them as a demonstration of how to add a title.
    // Since we're using Quarto, I suggest DELETING or commenting these out.
    fontname="Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif"
    fontsize=30;   // Font size for the entire graph
    label="(remove this title from your final draft!)";
    labelloc="t";  // "t"op, "b"ottom, "c"enter of graph
    labeljust="c"; // "l"eft, "c"enter, "r"ight

    // I picked RED to make the canvas of the diagram clearer.
    // Your final figure should use bgcolor=transparent
    
    bgcolor=red;   // Use bgcolor=transparent for final plot

    //these are useful, but appear not to work with layout=neato
    //nodesep=2.00;  // Separation between nodes on the same level
    //ranksep=0.80;  // Separation between nodes on different levels
    //size="4,4";    // Graph size
    //center=false   // Center diagram within graph canvas.

    // See: https://graphviz.org/docs/layouts/neato/
    layout=neato  // Very useful for auto placing nodes.  Minimizes node/edge energy in system
    scale=1.2     // changes size of shapes all at once


    // Set defaults for nodes
    node [fontname="Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif",fontsize=10] // Smaller font size, reduced node size

    // Define nodes
    node [shape=box];
    course; institute; student;
    node [shape=ellipse];
    {node [label="name"] name0; name1; name2;}
    code; grade; number;
    
    node [shape=diamond,style=filled,color=lightgrey]; 
    "C-I"; "S-C"; "S-I";

    // Set defaults for edges then draw edges
    edge [fontname="Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif",fontsize=10] // Reduced font size for edges

    // Define edges
    name0 -- course;
    code -- course;
    course -- "C-I" [label="n"]; // Edge length
    "C-I" -- institute [label="1"]; // Edge length
    institute -- name1;
    institute -- "S-I" [label="1"]; // Edge length
    "S-I" -- student [label="n"]; // Edge length
    student -- grade;
    student -- name2;
    student -- number;
    student -- "S-C" [label="m"]; // Edge length
    "S-C" -- course [label="n"]; // Edge length

}

```

### Conceptual design in Crows foot notation

(add description here. Modify diagram!)

(styling mermaid diagrams is very tricky and requires knowledge and use of the CSS styles
used to create your mermaid diagrams.  For our purposes, this is plenty good enough.
To learn more use this prompt in clean ChatGPT: 
  "i'm using mermaid to create crow's foot notion er diagrams.  can I directly position where each entity is placed?"
)

```{mermaid}
erDiagram 
    
    BOOK {
        int bookID
        string title
    }

    AUTHOR {
        int authorID
        string name
    }

    AUTHOR ||--o{ BOOK : writes
```

### Design assumptions, considerations and tradeoffs

(describe your assumptions. Discuss any design tradeoffs or consideration.)

### Relation sets

The following are the initial relation sets for the system:

* building( <ins>building_id</ins>, address, owner_name )

## (Title of model 2 goes here!)

(add description copy/pasted from description)

### Conceptual design in Chen Notation

(as above, add ER diagram using Chen notation)

### Conceptual design in Crows foot notation

(as above, add ER diagram using Crows Foot notation)

### Design assumptions, considerations and tradeoffs
