# Welcome to Homework 2 - CMSC408 - Fall 2024

( This text is to be replaced with a description of your repo and the homework assignment.)
( YOU must MAKE THIS YOUR OWN.  I'm trying to help you create a habit of ALWAYS modifying the README.md)
( GITHUB will create a pretty front page for your repository from this markdown file.)

To learn more about writing good README.md files, see:

<https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/>

This is a scaffold project. Iâ€™ll be providing scaffolds throughout the
semester to get you working faster, and to make grading much easier for
the TA team.

This repository supports Homework 2. Here are the homework specs and tasks:
